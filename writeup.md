The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Pipeline

The Lane detection pipeline consists of 6 steps:
1. A mask is generated by thresholding the image over a color range targeting the lighter regions.
2. Canny edge detection is applied to this mask to find edges in the image.
3. A region mask is used to remove all edges that do not correspond to road lanes.
4. Hough transform is used to convert all remaining edges into lines.
5. Using the y-intercepts the lines are clustered left or right road lane. (Note: Any lines
that are not clustered into either left or right lane is discarded). The
mean of these clusters in used to represent the final left and right lane.
6. Lanes are converted back from hough space and displayed on the original image.

### Potential shortcomings with current pipeline

* The pipeline is the color dependent. Different lighting conditions (e.g. night time)
or road conditions (e.g. snow or water) renders the algorithm ineffective.
* The algorithm relies heavily on edges. Therefore, gradient changes on the road caused by
artifacts such as shadows results in false positives. This can be seen in the output of
the challenge video.
* The algorithms has more than 15 different tunable parameters. The shear number of parameters
make it harder to use the algorithm in newer situations (e.g. different camera setup).


### Possible improvements to your pipeline

* Switching to HSV color space will help with varying lighting conditions because it
 separates the image intensity from the color information.
* Lane detection from lines can be improved by using better outlier detection methods.
Better clustering algorithms such as k-means can also be used to improve grouping the lines
together.
* Tracking lane markers between frames can help smooth the transition between frames.
* A deep neural network can use used for lane detection. This method removes the
need to manually find features and tune them.
